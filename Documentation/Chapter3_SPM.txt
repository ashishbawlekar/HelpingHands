If this free time or atleast some of it, was utilized in helping others, the nation could be a much better place. With the rise of social media and the information age, there is an sufficient awareness about the anguish of people, there are many willing to help but have no idea where to start.
There's also the problem of authenticity of organizations that they would like to help out but have no way of verifying without visiting there, which might not be the safest option. 

So to summarize the problems tackled in this project are: 
Helping Volunteers=> Helping volunteers volunteering by providing nearby events. 
Helping NGOs => Helping NGOs congregate people for their events.
